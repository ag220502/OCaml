(* Program For Program for Adding two numbers and printing the result *)
(* ============================================================ *)

(* -------- For Integer Numbers ----------- *)
(* Taking number in first variable *)
let firstNum : int = 20;;
(* Taking number in second variable *)
let secNum : int = 7;;
(* Adding both the numbers and storing it in third variable *)
let thirdNum : int = firstNum + secNum;;
(* Printing the result *)
thirdNum;;

(* -------- For Float Numbers ----------- *)
(* Taking number in first variable *)
let firNum : float = 20.5;;
(* Taking number in second variable *)
let secNum : float = 7.5;;
(* Adding both the numbers and storing it in third variable *)
let thirNum : float = firNum +. secNum;;
(* Printing the result *)
thirNum;;
